Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The initial datasets to be analyzed are called “Mouse_metadata.csv” and "Study_Results", they can be found under Pymaceuticals/data folder. 
In this repository you can also find a script where the following methods were used for the analysis: Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, merged, cleaned and aggregate data into Pandas dataframes, GroupBy, PyPlot(Bar,Box, Pie, Scatter), Stastical analysis: Correlation and Linear Regression.
